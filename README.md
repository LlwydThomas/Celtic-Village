# Celtic Village - A City-Building and Resource Management Game.
The aim of the project is to develop a 2D computer game for the PC through the Unity Game Engine which incorporates genres such as City-Building and Resource Management. The game is centred around villagers that complete tasks in order to amass resources which can subsequently be used to build more advanced structures and to more efficiently collect resources. This project attempts to satisfy this vision through the development of a game within Unity using C#.
   
A goal of the project is to explore game development with a methodical approach, namely the employment of software design techniques and architectural patterns to create a modular, well structured game. The game itself contains a number of complex systems which must communicate with each other in order to function correctly, and thus testing is integral to providing a functional and polished game.  The simplicity of the game's art style and lack of animation allows the project to focus mainly on the technical aspects of game development.

All C# scripts are located in "Assets/Scripts" under the relevant MVC folder.
